### Objective (What): What did we learn today
- Keep improving / changing the code based on the new requirement the client gave.

### Reflective (Gut): Use one word to express your feelings about today's class
- Enlightening, knowing the requirement is changing over time.

### Interpretive (So What): What was the most meaningful aspect of this activity
- Sometimes we need to keep refactoring our code base on the new requirement from the client.

### Decisional (Now What): Where do you most want to apply what you have learned today
- When I have a similar situation in the future, I will make sure that we clarify the requirement more clearly in order to prevent refactoring the code over and over again.
